# Dear Hon. Minister:
  


  

We are writing to express grave concerns over thecurrent condition of the Chen brothers (Chen Zhiheng and Chen Zhiyu), bothCanadian citizens, who were believed to have been abducted to China whilevisiting Singapore.
  

The brothers were recently seen making publicconfession on Chinese TV to document forgery that we believe is coerced anduntrue.  Based on recorded phoneconversations released by the billionaire political dissident Mr. Miles Kwok, andcertified by credited agencies within the United States government, thebrothers are clearly fighting for improving human-rights and democracy inChina.  We feel it's mostly important forour government to stand strong against the brutal Chinese dictators on behalfof its own citizens so to encourage activities that could bring positivepolitical changes in China.
  

We strongly urge our government to issue a diplomaticprotest against the government of China and the government of Singapore for theoutrageous abduction that breaks international law and demand the brothers'immediate release.
  

In addition, we also demand our government to ensurean independent and impartial inquiry into potential human rights violationsduring the time when the brothers are in Chinese custody.
  


  

We look forward to receiving a response from you.
  


  

Yours sincerely,
